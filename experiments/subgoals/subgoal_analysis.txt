Betweenness subgoals:
	
1) 2 moves from initial state. Clears up much of the central line which allows edge pieces to come in.
2) 2 moves from initial state 
3) 5 moves in
4) 3 moves in
5) 9 moves in
6) 4 moves in
7) 7 moves in
8) 9 moves in
9) 6 moves in
10) 6 moves in

I think it makes sense to have subgoals near the start as well as middle and nearing end because, you can lose the game very early.

Closeness :

1) 1 move from win - trivial
2) Terminal losing state
3) Terminal losing state
4) Terminal losing state
5) Terminal losing state
6) Terminal losing state
7) Terminal losing state
8) Terminal losing state
9) 1 move from losing state, can only lose from here
10) Terminal losing state

Degree:
1) 6 moves in
2) 7 moves in 
3) 3 moves in
4) 8 moves in
5) 7 moves in
6) 5 moves in
7) 5 moves in
8) 6 moves in
9) 6 moves in
10) 6 moves in

Eigenvector:
1) Winning state
2) Losing state
3) Losing state
4) Losing state
5) Losing state
6) Losing state
7) Losing state
8) Losing state
9) Losing state
10) Losing State

Katz : 
1) 1 from losing
2) 7 pegs, can win
3) 6 pegs, can't win
4) 5 pegs, can't win
5) 7 pegs, can't win
6) 6 pegs terminal loss
7) 6 pegs terminal loss
8) 3 pegs, 2 moves from winning - guaranteed win
9) 5 pegs, 1 move from loss
10) 6 pegs, can't win

Load :
1) Same as betweenness 1 - 2 moves from init
2) Same as betweenness 2 - 2 moves from init
3) 5 moves in
4) 5 moves in
5) 4 moves in
6) 10 moves in, good subgoal
7) 10 moves in, good subgoal
8) 6 moves in, good subgoal
9) 7 moves in, good subgoal - leads to a win
10) 8 moves in, good subgoal - leads to a win
