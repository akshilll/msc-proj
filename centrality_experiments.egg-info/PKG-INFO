Description: # Graph Centrality for Option Discovery
        Experiments comparing graph centrality measures in subgoal detection for option discovery
        
        ## Setup
        
        Running the code in this repo requires the installation of BaRL_SimpleOptions which can be found [here](https://github.com/Ueva/BaRL-SimpleOptions) as well as **networkx**, **numpy** and **pickle**.
        
        
        ## Running
        
        To run the experiments navigate to **experiments/** and run **run_agent.py** which will generate options for each centrality from a previously computed graph and run 1000 episodes for 400 agents for each centrality and one for a primitive Q learning agent. The results will be pickled and stored in **experiments/results/**. **experiments/results/make_graph.py** can be used to generate figures displaying the results.
